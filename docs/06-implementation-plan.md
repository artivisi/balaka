### Account Balances (Materialized) - Performance Optimization

**Not implemented.** The system uses real-time calculation by querying journal_entries directly.

**Why not materialized?**
- Current approach: Sum debit/credit from journal_entries for each report
- PostgreSQL performance with indexes is excellent for typical transaction volumes
- Materialization adds complexity: triggers, recalculation logic, cascade updates
- Trade-off: Simple architecture vs. marginal performance gain

**Performance analysis (PostgreSQL with proper indexes):**
- 10,000 journal lines: <50ms (5 years @ 80 tx/month)
- 50,000 journal lines: ~100ms (5 years @ 400 tx/month)
- 100,000 journal lines: ~200ms (5 years @ 800 tx/month)
- 500,000 journal lines: ~500ms (5 years @ 4,000 tx/month)

**For typical small IT services (100 tx/month):** Would take 40+ years to reach 100,000 lines.

**When to reconsider:** Only if report generation consistently exceeds 2 seconds and users report slowness (>500 transactions/month sustained for several years).

**Implementation approach if needed:**
- [ ] Create account_balances table with monthly snapshots
- [ ] Trigger balance update on journal entry post/void
- [ ] Background job for period-based aggregation
- [ ] Balance recalculation utility for data fixes
- [ ] Modify ReportService to query materialized balances instead of journal_entries

### Document Management Enhancements
- [ ] S3-compatible storage backend
- [ ] Image compression on upload
- [ ] PDF optimization
- [ ] ClamAV virus scanning
- [ ] Bulk upload
- [ ] Document access logging

### Advanced Features (As Needed)

- [ ] Dashboard analytics
- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Admin: view soft-deleted records

### Custom Projects (Per Client Request)
- [ ] PJAP integration (e-Faktur, e-Bupot)
- [ ] Digital signature (PSrE)
- [ ] E-Meterai integration
- [ ] Payment gateway integration

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security schema (users)
- V002: Security data (admin user)
- V003: App schema (COA, journal entries, templates, transactions, etc.)
- V004: App seed data
- V901-V907: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
